This assignment asks you to re-solve Program 2 using parallel arrays and range matching (as in the Chapter 7 PowerPoint supplementary slides) to perform the decision making for the selection of registration time. Use your instructor's solution to Program 2 Version 3 as your starting point. Keep the rest of the decision logic for assigning the registration date the same. Remember, Program 2 asked you to create a Windows Forms GUI application that will determine the earliest time that a continuing UofL undergraduate student may register for SummerFall 2016 courses using the priority registration schedule available from the Registrar's site SummerFall 2016 Priority Registration Schedule for Continuing Students.

Be sure to add appropriate comments in your code, including your name, program number, due date, and course section. Each variable used in your program needs a comment describing its purpose. Put these at the top of file that holds your event handler(s). You may leave the other files including Program.cs unchanged. Do not worry about the GUI variables, as they are auto-generated in the .Designer.cs file. These requirements are expected for every program and are listed in the syllabus. Preconditions and postconditions are now required, as well.
